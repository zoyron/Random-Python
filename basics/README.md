## data types in python

```{python}

# here the data type will not be assigned to the variable x, rather it will be assigned to the reference in the memory that is assigned to the variable x, i.e. 10 in this case since it is the reference in the memory that is assigned to the variable x.
x = 10
# in other words the type of x is not a number-type, rather the value stored inside x has type as number-type
# the values stored inside python objects/variables have types not the variables/objects themselves
x = "random python"
# in the above line the string stored inside x has a string-type, the variable/object in itself doesn't
```
